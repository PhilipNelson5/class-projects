was
many
and
many
year
ago
kingdom
the
sea
that
there
lived
whom
you
may
know
the
name
and
this
she
lived
with
other
thought
than
love
and
loved
was
child
and
she
was
child
this
kingdom
the
sea
but
loved
with
love
that
was
more
than
love
and
with
love
that
the
heaven
her
and
and
this
was
the
reason
that
long
ago
this
kingdom
the
sea
wind
blew
out
cloud
beautiful
that
her
came
and
bore
her
away
from
shut
her
this
kingdom
the
sea
the
angels
not
half
happy
heaven
went
her
and
yes
that
was
the
reason
all
men
know
this
kingdom
the
sea
that
the
wind
came
out
the
cloud
night
and
killing
but
our
love
was
stronger
far
than
the
love
those
who
were
older
than
many
far
wiser
than
and
neither
the
angels
heaven
above
nor
the
down
under
the
sea
can
ever
soul
from
the
soul
the
beautiful
for
the
moon
never
beams
without
bringing
dreams
the
beautiful
and
the
stars
never
rise
but
feel
the
bright
eyes
the
beautiful
and
all
the
lie
down
the
side
darling
darling
life
and
the
there
the
sea
her
the
sounding
sea
the
once
upon
midnight
dreary
while
weak
and
weary
over
many
and
curious
volume
forgotten
while
nearly
suddenly
there
came
some
one
gently
chamber
door
some
muttered
chamber
door
only
this
and
nothing
more
distinctly
remember
was
the
and
each
separate
dying
its
ghost
upon
the
floor
eagerly
wished
the
had
sought
borrow
from
books
for
the
lost
for
the
rare
and
whom
the
angels
name
nameless
here
for
and
the
sad
uncertain
each
antidisestablishmentarianism
purple
curtain
filled
with
fantastic
terrors
never
felt
before
that
now
still
the
beating
heart
stood
repeating
some
entrance
chamber
door
some
late
entrance
chamber
door
this
and
nothing
more
presently
soul
grew
stronger
then
longer
sir
said
truly
your
but
the
fact
was
and
gently
you
came
and
you
came
chamber
door
that
scarce
was
sure
heard
you
here
opened
wide
the
door
darkness
there
and
nothing
more
deep
into
that
darkness
long
stood
there
wondering
fearing
dreaming
dreams
mortal
ever
dared
dream
before
but
the
silence
was
and
the
gave
token
and
the
only
word
there
spoken
was
the
word
this
and
echo
back
the
word
merely
this
and
nothing
more
back
into
the
chamber
turning
all
soul
within
burning
soon
again
heard
somewhat
louder
than
before
surely
said
surely
that
something
window
let
see
then
what
and
this
mystery
explore
let
heart
still
moment
and
this
mystery
explore
the
wind
and
nothing
more
open
here
the
when
with
many
and
there
stepped
the
days
not
the
least
made
not
minute
stopped
stayed
but
with
lord
lady
above
chamber
door
upon
bust
just
above
chamber
door
and
sat
and
nothing
more
then
this
bird
sad
fancy
into
smiling
the
grave
and
the
wore
though
thy
and
thou
said
art
sure
ghastly
grim
and
ancient
wandering
from
the
tell
what
thy
name
the
nights
the
much
this
hear
plainly
though
its
answer
little
meaning
little
bore
for
cannot
help
agreeing
that
living
human
being
ever
yet
was
blessed
with
seeing
bird
above
his
chamber
door
bird
beast
upon
the
bust
above
his
chamber
door
with
such
name
but
the
sitting
lonely
the
bust
spoke
only
that
one
word
his
soul
that
one
word
did
nothing
farther
then
not
then
till
scarcely
more
than
muttered
other
friends
have
flown
before
the
will
leave
hopes
have
flown
before
then
the
bird
said
startled
the
broken
reply
spoken
doubtless
said
what
its
only
stock
and
store
caught
from
some
unhappy
master
whom
disaster
followed
fast
and
followed
faster
till
his
songs
one
burden
bore
till
the
his
hope
that
burden
bore
never
but
the
still
sad
fancy
into
smiling
straight
seat
front
bird
and
bust
and
door
then
upon
the
sinking
myself
linking
fancy
unto
fancy
thinking
what
this
bird
what
this
grim
ghastly
and
bird
meant
this
sat
engaged
guessing
but
expressing
the
whose
eyes
now
burned
into
core
this
and
more
sat
with
head

lining
with
the
