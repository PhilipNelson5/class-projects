Create a program that does the following:

1. Creates two class member variables (This means theyâ€™re inside the class)
  * fName stores your first name
  * lName stores your last name
2. Create a method called printName that will print your name and a message to the command line. (Use the Hello World template to see how to print)
3. Call printName from the main method, do not just have the print statement in the main method.
4. Use standard class conventions (see class conventions document)
