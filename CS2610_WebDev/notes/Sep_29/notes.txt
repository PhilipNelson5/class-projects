HTML Forms
==========
	Think about what "form" means (form.jpg)

	No, not that form. More like this kind (mcform.png)

	The webpages we've used so far are one-way communication. HTML Forms allow
	us to talk back to webservers.


Syntax
======

	To create a form section, we provide the form with a name, id, action, and
	method. An example with blank attributes looks like this:

		<form action="" method="">

			<!-- labels, buttons, sliders, text boxes, etc. go in here :) -->

		</form>


	Attributes
	----------

		At minimum the form needs to know where to go and how to get there

		* action - the URL your browser sends the user upon form submission
		* method - how to send the user's carefully entered data to the server

		  Method refers to HTTP - HyperText Transport Protocol
		  HTTP is a set of rules that servers and browsers follow in order to
		  communicate.

		  It was originally created coincidentally with HTML to define how our
		  new, fancy webpages should be sent from server to browser.
		  Lots of systems besides webservers and web browsers use it nowadays.


Form input elements
===================
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form#The_<label>_<input>_and_<textarea>_elements

	<label>
	-------
		for="" -> an input's #id
			Associates the label to a form input so that by clicking on the
			label the browser will focus on the associated input.
		

	<input>
	-------
		id=""
			The input's ID (same #id as we've seen before in CSS)
		name=""
			The name of the value in the URL after the ?
		type=""
			What sort of input widget - text entry, slider, checkbox, etc.
