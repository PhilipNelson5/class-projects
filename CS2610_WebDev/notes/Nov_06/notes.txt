API = Application Programming Interface
    The traditional definition refered to libraries of code used within a
    programming environment. An API describes the packages you can import,
    objects you can use, functions you can call and what types of data those
    functions return. An API may also describe protocols used to facilitate
    communication between different systems.

    More recently this acronym has become closely associated with web-based
    technologies. The API in use by a web service may describe the URLs from
    which certain data may be retrieved, what format that data will be sent
    (i.e. XML, JSON, etc.) and what data may be uploaded from the client.

Redirects - why not stay on the POST view?
	If I want to see the results I must change the results
	If I simply reload the results page I also change the results

	It is therefore better design to separate the act of voting from the act
	of viewing the results
