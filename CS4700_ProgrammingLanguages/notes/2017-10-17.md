### Encapsulation and Information Hiding
* does the language support thinking at the right level of abstraction 
* does the language support thinking at multiple levels of abstraction
* consider float
  * you don't need to know IEEE standard for floating point numbers in order to use it

#### Type Checking
* Ensuring the types are compatible
* Coercion is automatic conversion
* mismatch

#### Type Equivelance
* Types are equivalent if no coercion is needed for compatibility
* Name Equivalence - types are the same if they are named the same
* Structure Equivalence - types are the same if the structure is the same
