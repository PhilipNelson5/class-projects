### Encapsulation and Information Hiding
* does the language support thinking at the right level of abstraction 
* does the language support thinking at multiple levels of abstraction
* consider float
  * you don't need to know IEEE standard for floating point numbers in order to use it

#### Type Checking
* Ensuring the types are compatible
* Coercion is automatic conversion
* mismatch

#### Type Equivelance
* Types are equivalent if no coercion is needed for compatibility
* Name Equivalence - types are the same if they are named the same
* Structure Equivalence - types are the same if the structure is the same

#### Strong Types
* Strongly typed languages always detect errors
* no language **REALLY** is strongly tyled
* Java checks types at runtime so it's close

#### Primitive types
* Defined by the language
* Not redefinable
* Types
  * Integer
  * Floating Point
  * Complex
  * Decimal - fixed point number
  * Boolean
  * Character

#### Enumerations
* What forms of coercion are allowed
* What is the scope of the constants
* How visible is the underlying structure

#### Array
* What are legal subscripts?
* Is the array range checked?
* What operations are allowed?
  * Slicing - extract sub-arrays
  * Membership - does the element exist in the array
  * Transposition - changing indices
  * Concatenation - can you concatenate 

##### Array Categories
* Static - declared before runtime - global
* Fixed stack dynamic -
* Fixed heap dynamic - 
* Heap dynamic - vector

##### Array Implementation
* Are multidimensional arrays allowed?
* Is it column or row major?

#### Strings
* Are they character arrays or a special type?
* Static or dynamic?

##### String Operations
* Slice
* Concatenate
* Compare
* Regular Expressions


#### Lists
* Very common in functional languages
* List comprehensions
  * Construct one list form another via a function
* Range
* Infinite lists
  * lazy evaluation makes infinite list possible

#### Associative Arrays
* also called hash, dictionary, or map

#### Records
* Records are formed by concatenating two or more types called fields
  * struct

#### Tuples
* A record of unnamed types

#### Union
* List of types and value is at most one of the listed types
* Discriminated - knows the type
* Free - does not know the type

#### Pointers
* Entity is a reference to some other entity
* Pointers are addresses
* References refer to objects

##### Pointer Problems
* Dangling pointers, null_ptr
* Garbage - used to point to something
* Reference Semantics - Aliasing

##### Garbage Collection
* Reference counting
* Mark and sweep

#### User Defined Types
