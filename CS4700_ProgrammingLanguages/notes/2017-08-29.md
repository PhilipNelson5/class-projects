It's always a people problem

### Subjective Evaluation
* choose a language that has been around as long as you expect your project to live
* programming languages is a multi-valued optimization problem
* pareto optimized curve - gain on one axis is a loss on another

### Axes
* ##### Readability
  * how easily can an algorithm be read
  * is it easy for a novice vs an expert?
* ##### Writeability
  * what are the existing constructs
  * do you say "Do this thing" or do you spell everything out
  * if you spell everything out you need to understand every way to read it
