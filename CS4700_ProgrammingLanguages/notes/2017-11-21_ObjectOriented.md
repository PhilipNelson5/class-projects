# Object Oriented Programming

### Dominant Design Practice
* Roots in SIMULA 67 and the lambda calculus
* Considered to have begun with SmallTalk 80
* Currently the dominant practice
* Too many people believe that 'object oriented' is synonymous with 'good design' - Bjarne Stroustrup

### 3 Key Features
* Abstract data types
  * can you define a data type?
* Inheritance
* Dynamic binding

### Inheritance
* original goal: improve productivity via reuse
* ADT's (Abstract Data Types) promise reuse but in practice aren't always the perfect fit
* Existing types are often close but not quite right

### Inheritance
* Ability to take an ATD and extend/modify it without modifying the original
* Provides an organizational framework
* Works up to ~100,000 lines of code :P

### Multiple Inheritance
* does the language support having multiple parents?
* makes the tree into a graph

### Subtypes
* Does the language supper the principle of substitution
* is derived an instance of base?

### Dynamic Binding
* substitution and extension require 

### Exclusive Objects
* is every user defined type an object
* Do all objects inherit from a superclass (Object)
