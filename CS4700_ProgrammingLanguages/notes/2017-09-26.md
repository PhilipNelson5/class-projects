### Bindings

#### Identifiers
* name forms
  * What are legal characters?
  * Are names case sensitive?
* Special words
  * Key words - defined in the language
    * recognized by the scanner
  * reserved words - predefined but user can redefine
    * you can change a key word
* Binding
  * Associating an attribute and an entity (typically a name)
  * Binding is static if it begins before runtime and can not change throughout runtime
  * Binding is dynamic if it can change
* Binding Time
  * Language Design
    * keywords
    * `if` `static` ...
  * Language Implementation Time
  * Compile Time
  * Compile Time
    * constants
  * Link Time
  * Load Time
  * static ^ / dynamic v
  * Run Time
* Variables
  * is a binding of an entity to an attribute
  * Type 
    * Domain of possible values the variable can take on
  * Value
    * The specific value from the domain
* Aliases
  * If the state changes made through one name are visible through another, the two names are aliases
    * Pointers
  * Sources of subtle bugs
  * When choosing a language, decide if you need aliasing or have access to aliasing
* Variables
  * type
  * value
    * L-values
      * must have meory asocciated with them
    * R-values
      * may not have memory assiciated with it
      * pure
        * literals ex: `3`
      * expiring R-values
        * an L-value just before destruction
    All L-values are R-values
* Named Constants
  * Bound to a value only once
* Lifetime
  * Static
    * Lifetime of the program
    * Static Binding
  * Stack-Dynamic
    * Local Variables
    * Bound to a scope
    * Spacial and Temporal bindings are 1 to 1
  * Explicit Heap-Dynamic
    * `new` and `delete`
    * breaks the spacial-temporal binding
  * Implicit Heap-Dynamic
    * the language does the allocation 
    * garbage collected languages
* Scope
  * The range of statements where something is visible
  * An object is *visible* if it can be references
  * An object is **local** to a scope if it is defined there
  * An object is **global** if it is visible everywhere
  * Static Scope
    * Also called Lexicographic scope
    * Scope can be determined prior to runtime using only the source code
    * Allows for many optimizations
  * Dynamic Scope
    * Scope depends of the runtime context
    * Generally considered less reliable
    * Harder to reason about
* Reference Environment
  * What is visible to a statement
  * All variables (global, local, etc...) that are visible
* Block
  * A set of statements
  * Starts a new scope
  * Generally used in statically scoped languages
