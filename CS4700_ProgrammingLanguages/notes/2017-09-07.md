### Postscript

#### History
* Adobe product
* first released in 1984
* first language to combine raster graphics and text
* predecessor of pdf

#### Display
* was tried as a basis for a display engine
* X11 project killed that

#### Languages Properties
* Turing complete
* Concatenative language
  * very good at function composition
  * natural to concatenate functions
* is a "points free" language
  * empty domain
  * funtion takes no parameters
  * global stack

#### Stack
* 2 stacks
  * this alone makes a language turing complete

#### Literals
* literals have the effect of placing their bound values on the stack

#### Operators (functions)
* take values from the stack and place return values on the stack

#### Stack Manipulators
* `clear` - clears the stack
* `dup` coppies the top element of the stack
* `exch` - swap top two elements
* `pop` - removes the top of the stack
* `roll` - \<num elements>\<roll ammount>roll

#### Operators
* `add`
* `sub`
* `div`
* `idiv` - integer division
* `sin` - angle in degrees
* `cos` - angle in degrees

#### Drawing
* drawing happens in two steps
  * create a path
  * stroke or fill that path
  * (0,0) is lower right corner
* Path
  * new path
  * moveto - consumes 2 items from stack
  * lineto 
  * rmoveto - relative
  * rlineto - relative

#### Dictionaries

#### Executable Arrays
* List of literals in braces

#### Conditions
