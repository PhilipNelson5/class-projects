### Syntax and Simantix

#### Language
* Given an alphabet (set of chars)
* A language is a set of character strings
* All commutable questions can be framed in terms of languages

#### Recognizer
* a machine (mathematical procedure) that returns true or false given a string a characters
* some languages never return if false

#### Generator
* a generator is a machine (sometimes non-deterministic) that can produce every element of a language
  * given an infinite amount of time

#### Hierarchy of computable languages
* regular
* context free
* context sensitive
  * all programming languages
* each class is a proper subset of the next

#### Lexeme
* a lexeme is a word in a programming language
* most basic structure
* the language of legal lexemes for a programming ...

#### Lexical Analysis
* process of translating a stream of characters into lexemes

#### Regular Expression
* Concatenation
  * ab
* Alternation
  * a|b
* Kleene Closure
  * a\*
######
* all finite languages are regular
  * list all words and *or* them together

#### Finite Automata
* Automata - Machine
* Finite Automata has a finite number of parts
* Parts:
  * states
    * initial state is labeled with a "-"
    * final state is labeled with a "+"
    * a single start is deterministic
    * final state is labeled
  * transitions between states
    * labeled with letters from the alphabet

#### Finite Automata = Regular Expressions ??
* Build a Regular Expression from a Finite Automata
  * can be done
* Build a Finite Automata from a Regular Expression
  * can be done
* Both describe the same set of languages

#### Push-down Automata
* Push and Pop

#### Context Free Grammer (CFG))
* terminals -> alphabet of language
* non terminals -> not in language
* rules


* Non-deterministic Finite Automata = Deterministic Finite Automata
* Non-deterministic Push Down Automata = Deterministic Push Down Automata
* NP ? P
