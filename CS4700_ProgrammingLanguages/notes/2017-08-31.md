# Alan Mathison Turing
  negative cost c++ programming
### Languages Covered / applications needed
* ghost script (Post Script)
* SWI prolog
* Haskell
* new LISP

Haskell and Prolog are vastly different

### Evaluation
* **readability** is important for maintainability
* Sometimes **writeability** is good for quick tools
  * Enjoyability
* **reliability**
  * How easily can bugs be written
  * ex. buffer overflow
* **cost**
  * How does language choice affect development cost?
  * Familiarity with language
  * How suited is the language to the problem?
  * Portability
* **performance** 
  * How quickly will the resulting program execute
  * Do you care about performance? often not. human timescales are slow
  * You either care about it above everything or not at all

### Domains
* **Scientific Community** (computer games) - Fortran
  * Complex simulations over large data
  * CPU bound (not human time scales)
  * Always bigger problems to solve
  * Always performance oriented
* **Business** - COBOL
  * Large data
  * IO bound (human time scales)
  * Non-technical audience (even for the code)
  * Geared for programmer productivity
* **Artificial Intelligence** - LISP
  * Big-O complex problems
  * More about manipulating lists of symbols than bits
* **Web Software** - JavaScript
  * Portability
  * Security
  * Need for ability to be segmented and run in parts

Need to evaluate languages in their domain

### Characteristics
* **Simplicity**
  * How many ways can you write the same thing?
  * How many things can a symbol or construct mean
  * Operator overloading
  * Too simple - assembly Simplicity
* **Orthogonality**
  * Orthogonal features can be combined in any number of ways
  * How can a languages features be combined
* **Data Types**
  * What data types are supported
  * What is nativity supported
  * Std libs
* **Syntax Design**
  * Are key words chosen well
* **Abstraction Support**
  * Can you create your own types
  * Are your own types second class citizens?
  * How generic can functions be?
  * Allows you to isolate yourself to one level of the problem
* **Expressivity**
  * How easily can an idea be expressed
  * How directly can an idea be expressed
* **Type Checking**
  * How much compile time support is available for avoiding bugs
* **Exception Handling**
  * How does the language handle errors and exceptional cases
* **Restricted Aliasing**
  * What access do you have to raw memory
  * Can you have more than one name that points to the same memory
  * What support do you have to avoid memory errors
* **Portability**
  * How easy is it to transfer systems

### Influences
* von Neuman Architecture
  * Most languages are designed to for the von Neuman Architecture
* Compiling and Interpreting
  * Compile - before running
  * Interpret - at run time
