# Alan Mathison Turing
  negative cost c++ programming
### Languages Covered / applications needed
* ghost script (Post Script)
* SWI prolog
* Haskell
* new LISP

Haskell and Prolog are vastly different

### Evaluation
* **readability** is important for maintainability
* sometimes **writeability** is good for quick tools
  * enjoyability
* **reliability**
  * how easily can bugs be written
  * ex. buffer overflow
* **cost**
  * how does language choice affect development cost?
  * familiarity with language
  * how suited is the language to the problem?
  * portability
* **performance** 
  * how quickly will the resulting program execute
  * do you care about performance? often not. human timescales are slow
  * you either care about it above everything or not at all

### Domains
* **Scientific Community** (computer games) - Fortran
  * Complex simulations over large data
  * CPU bound (not human time scales)
  * Always bigger problems to solve
  * Always performance oriented
* **Business** - COBOL
  * Large data
  * IO bound (human time scales)
  * non-technical audience (even for the code)
  * geared for programmer productivity
* **Artificial Intelligence**  - LISP
  * Big-O complex problems
  * more about manipulating lists of symbols than bits
* **Web Software**  - JavaScript
  * Portability
  * Security
  * Need for ability to be segmented and run in parts

Need to evaluate languages in their domain

### Characteristics
* **Simplicity**
  * how many ways can you write the same thing?
  * how many things can a symbol or construct mean
  * operator overloading
  * too simple - assembly Simplicity
* **Orthogonality**
  * orthogonal features can be combined in any number of ways
  * how can a languages features be combined
* **Data Types**
  * what data types are supported
  * what is nativity supported
  * std libs
* **Syntax Design**
  * Are key words chosen well
* **Abstraction Support**
  * can you create your own types
  * are your own types second class citizens?
  * how generic can functions be?
  * allows you to isolate yourself to one level of the problem
* **Expressivity**
  * how easily can an idea be expressed
  * how directly can an idea be expressed
* **Type Checking**
  * how much compile time support is available for avoiding bugs
* **Exception Handling**
  * how does the language handle errors and exceptional cases
* **Restricted Aliasing**
  * what access do you have to raw memory
  * can you have more than one name that points to the same memory
  * what support do you have to avoid memory errors
* **Portability**
  * how easy is it to transfer systems

### Influences
* von Neuman Architecture
  * most languages are designed to for the von Neuman Architecture
* Compiling and Interpreting
  * Compile - before running
  * Interpret - at run time
