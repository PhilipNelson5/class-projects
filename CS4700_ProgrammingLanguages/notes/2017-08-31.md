# Alan Mathison Turing
### Languages Covered / applications needed
* ghost script (Post Script)
* SWI prolog
* Haskell
* new LISP

Haskell and Prolog are vastly different

### Evaluation
* **readability** is important for maintainability
* sometimes **writeability** is good for quick tools
  * enjoyability
* **reliability**
  * how easily can bugs be written
  * ex. buffer overflow 
* **cost**
  * how does language choice affect development cost?
  * familiarity with language
  * how suited is the language to the problem?
  * portability
* **performance** 
  * how quickly will the resulting program execute
  * do you care about performance? often not. human timescales are slow
  * you either care about it above everything or not at all

### Domains
* Scientific community (computer games) - Fortran
  * Complex simulations over large data
  * CPU bound (not human time scales)
  * Always bigger problems to solve
  * Always performance oriented
* Business - COBOL
  * Large data
  * IO bound (human time scales)
  * non-technical audience (even for the code)
  * geared for programmer productivity
* Artificial Intelligence - LISP
  * Big-O complex problems
  * more about manipulating lists of symbols than bits
* Web Software - JavaScript
  * Portability
  * Security
  * Need for ability to be segmented and run in parts

Need to evaluate languages in their domain
