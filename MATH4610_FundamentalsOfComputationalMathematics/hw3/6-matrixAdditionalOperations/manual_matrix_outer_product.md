# Matrix Outer Product Software Manual

**Routine Name:** Matrix Outer Product

**Author:** Philip Nelson

**Language:** C++. The code can be compiled using the GNU C++ compiler (gcc). A make file is included to compile an example program

The outer product usually refers to the tensor product of vectors. If you want something like the outer product between a m×n matrix A and a p×q matrix B, you can see the generalization of outer product, which is the Kronecker product. This is implemented in [kronecker_product]("manual_kronecker_product.md").
