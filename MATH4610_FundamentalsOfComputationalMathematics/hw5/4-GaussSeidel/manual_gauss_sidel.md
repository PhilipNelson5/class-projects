# Gauss Seidel Software Manual

**Routine Name:** gauss_seidel

**Author:** Philip Nelson

**Language:** C++. The code can be compiled using the GNU C++ compiler (gcc). A make file is included to compile an example program

For example,

```
make
```

will produce an executable **./gaussSeidel.out** that can be executed.

**Description/Purpose:** Gauss Seidel is an iterative method used to solve a linear system of equations \\(Ax=b\\). It is named after the German mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel, and is similar to the Jacobi method. Though it can be applied to any matrix with non-zero elements on the diagonals, convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either diagonally dominant, or symmetric and positive definite. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussâ€“Seidel_method)

**Input:** The routine takes a matrix, A, and a right hand side, b.

**Output:** The routine returns x, the solution to A * x = b.

**Usage/Example:**

``` cpp
int main()
{
  auto A = generate_square_symmetric_diagonally_dominant_matrix(4u);
  auto b = generate_right_side(A);
  auto x = gauss_seidel(A, b);
  auto Ax = A * x;

  std::cout << " A\n" << A << std::endl;
  std::cout << " x\n" << x << std::endl;
  std::cout << " b\n" << b << std::endl;
  std::cout << " A * x\n" << Ax << std::endl;
}
```

**Output** from the lines above
```
 A
|       14.6      1.46      9.62      4.59 |
|       1.46      6.35      2.94     -6.32 |
|       9.62      2.94      13.6     -5.92 |
|       4.59     -6.32     -5.92     -11.4 |

 x
[          1         1         1         1 ]

 b
[       30.3      4.43      20.3     -19.1 ]

 A * x
[       30.3      4.43      20.3     -19.1 ]
```

_explanation of output_:

First, the matrix A is generated and displayed. It is a square matrix with uniformly distributed numbers and is symmetric and diagonally dominant. Then the rhs is computed and x is solved for and displayed. Finally b is shown and A * x is shown. We can see that b == A * x which is good.

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for gauss_seidel

In this code, maceps returns a [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple) with the machine epsilon and the precision. [std::get](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/get) is used to extract only the first value, the machine epsilon, from the returned tuple. The code also uses [std::fill](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill) to reset the x_new to all zeros each iteration.

``` cpp
template <typename T>
std::vector<T> gauss_seidel(Matrix<T>& A,
                           std::vector<T> const& b,
                           unsigned int const& MAX_ITERATIONS = 1000u)
{
  static const T macepsT = std::get<1>(maceps<T>());

  std::vector<T> x(b.size(), 0), x_new(b.size(), 0);

  for (auto k = 0u; k < MAX_ITERATIONS; ++k)
  {
    std::fill(std::begin(x_new), std::end(x_new), 0);
    for (auto i = 0u; i < A.size(); ++i)
    {
      auto s1 = 0.0, s2 = 0.0;
      for (auto j = 0u; j < i; ++j)
      {
        s1 += A[i][j] * x_new[j];
      }
      for (auto j = i + 1; j < A.size(); ++j)
      {
        s2 += A[i][j] * x[j];
      }
      x_new[i] = (b[i] - s1 - s2) / A[i][i];
    }

    if (allclose(x, x_new, macepsT))
    {
      return x_new;
    }
    x = x_new;
  }
  return x;
}
```
