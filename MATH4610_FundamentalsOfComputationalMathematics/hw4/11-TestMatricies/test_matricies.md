# Machine Precision in Practice

**Author:** Philip Nelson

The first resource that can be used to find test problems is [^matrix_market]. It is a website that hosts many test problems and has search functionality that can be used to query the database for the types of problems you would like to use. The Matrix Market is a service of the Mathematical and Computational Sciences Division of the Information Technology Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Development Status: Minimal Maintenance

Another resource is The SuiteSparse Matrix Collection[^sparce_matrix_collection] (formerly known as the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection), is a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments. This is less useful for our solvers because we like to use well-conditioned, dense matrices. But this is still a good future resource to remember.
