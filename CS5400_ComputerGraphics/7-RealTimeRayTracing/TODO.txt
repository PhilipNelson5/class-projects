[X] All rendering is performed using (recursive) ray-tracer
[X] Renders a plane that represents the horizon.
[X] Renders at least three spheres that with the following characteristics:
  [X]  Sphere is diffuse and specular
  [X]  Sphere is Reflective
  [X]  Sphere is 80% diffuse/specular and 20% reflective
[X] Renders a "sky" when no other object is intersected by the pixel ray.  Recommendation is to define a large sphere that encompasses the entire scene and the color the sphere in a way other than a single flat color.
[X] Provides an "interesting" animation/demonstration:
[X] At least one of the spheres must follow a curved path using one of the curve algorithms from earlier in the semester.
