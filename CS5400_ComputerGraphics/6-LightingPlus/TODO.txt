[X] Renders a skybox

[X] Renders one of the Stanford ply models with:
  [X] Per-fragment ambient
  [X] Per-fragment diffuse

[ ] Renders one of the Stanford ply models with:
  [ ] Per-fragment ambient
  [ ] Per-fragment diffuse
  [ ] Per-fragment specular

[ ] Renders one of the Stanford ply models with:
  [ ] Per-fragment reflection mapping; 100% reflection

[ ] Renders one of the Stanford ply models with:
  [ ] 80% per-fragment diffuse and specular
  [ ] 20% per-fragment reflection mapping

[X] Uses perspective projection.

[ ] Provides an "interesting" animation/demonstration of the rendering techniques

Notes:
* Should the model keep track of the program that it is rendered with?
  * model.program
* Should the model have a list of associations 

    OR

* Should there be functions to render each thing?
  * renderSkyBox(skyBox)
  * renderDiffuse(model)
  * renderSpectral(model)
  * ...
