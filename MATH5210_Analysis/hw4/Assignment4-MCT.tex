Math 5210 Assignment 4. Monotone Convergence Theorem

\bigskip

1. Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence of non-negative real numbers. Show that the partial sums for the infinite series $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } a_n$ form a monotone series.

\bigskip

2. What is the approximation property for the infimum of a set $A$? If $m = \inf(A)$, prove that there is a sequence $a_n \in $ with $\lim a_n = m$. Follow the proof given in class.

\bigskip

3. Give a detailed proof of the MCT in the case of a monotone decreasing sequence which is bounded below. Follow the proof given in class.

\bigskip

4. If $0 < r < 1$, show that $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} r^n= 0$. Note that with $a_n = r^n$, $a_{n+1} = r a_n$. What happens if $0 \leq r \leq 1$?

\bigskip

5. Let $a_1 \in (0, 1)$ Prove that $a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a_{n} +1} -1 $ is a increasing sequence which converges to 0. What happens if $a_0 = 0$, if $a_0 = -1$?

\bigskip

6. Suppose $a_1 \geq 2$ and $a_{n +1} = 2 + \sqrt{a_n - 2}$. Show that $a_n$ converges to 2 or 3. How does the limit depend upon the value of $a_1$

\bigskip

7. (Bonus) Let $0 < b_1 < a_1$ and let

\begin{equation*}
 a_{n+1} = \frac{a_n + b_n}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad b_{n+1} = \sqrt{a_n b_n}
\end{equation*}

\medskip

a) Show that $0 < b_n < a_n$

\medskip

b) Show that $b_n$ is increasing and bounded above.

\medskip
c) Show that $a_n$ is decreasing and bounded below.

\medskip
d) Show that $ 0 < a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} < (a_1 - b_1)/2^n$

\medskip
e) Conclude that the sequences $a_n$ and $b_n$ converge to a common limit.
