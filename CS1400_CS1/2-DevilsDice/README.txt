Text based game "The Devil's Dice"

In this assignment, you are to write a program to play a game of Devil's Dice with the user.

Devil's Dice is a popular IOS game developed by Soft Dorothy, LLC that is based on the folk game "Pig". You can learn more about Devil's Dice at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-devils-dice/id473597789?mt=8 (Links to an external site.) and about Pig at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game) (Links to an external site.). The rules of the games as described on Wikipedia are:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die (Links to an external site.) until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":-

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, the first player, Ann, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Ann could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.

In this assignment, you need to re-do the devil's dice game, but use text output statements to emulate the screen in the IOS game. In your code, you must:

Use at least one function devoted to printing out the screen.

Ask the user after the game if he/she wants to play again.
