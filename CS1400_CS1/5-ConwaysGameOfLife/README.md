# cs1.5.1.ConwaysGameOfLife
Text based Conway's game of life simulation

In this assignment, you are to write a program that simulates Conway's Game of Life.  

You can learn all about the Game of Life at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life (Links to an external site.).  

From wikipedia:

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal (Links to an external site.) grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours (Links to an external site.), which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 

What to do:

1. Write a program that simulates the Game of Life

2. Use at least one std::array or std::vector

3. Your program should demonstrate a variety of shapes.
